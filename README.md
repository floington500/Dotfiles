# Dotfiles

A place for me to store configuration files for Linux on the cloud.

## Usage

To use any of these configurations, just clone the repo and create a symbolic link from the designated folder which you need the configuration in.

You can also just copy and paste it if you choose to do so of course, this is just my preference.
